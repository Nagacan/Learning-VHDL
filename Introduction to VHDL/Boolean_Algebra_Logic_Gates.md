1) An AND Gate only gives out a **true (high, 1) value when all of its inputs are 1**. It is denoted by a dot symbol (.) in Boolean algebra. Its truth table is given below:

2)  An OR Gate is sort of opposite of AND, only giving false (low, 0) value when all its inputs are 0, while giving a true value if at least one of it's values are 1. **It gives a true output when any one of the inputs is true otherwise gives a false output**. It is denoted by a plus symbol (+) in Boolean algebra.

3)  A NOT gate basiaclly just gives out the **opposite output with respect to the **input. It is denoted by a bar(over-score/over-line) symbol (‾) or a dash symbol (‘) in Boolean algebra. Its truth table is given below.

4) A NOR Gate is a derived gate made up of a NOT and OR gate. It gives a true output when all** **the inputs are false otherwise gives a false output. **In other words, when all inputs are 0 it outputs 1, and all other combinations give 0**. It is denoted by the combination of the plus(+) and bar(‾) symbols in Boolean algebra. Its truth table is given below:

5) A NAND gate is a derived gate made up of a NOT and AND gate. It gives a 1 output when **any one** of the inputs is 0 otherwise it gives a 0 output. It is denoted by the combination of the dot(.) and bar(‾) symbols in Boolean algebra.

6) A XOR Gate is konwn as exclusive OR Gate, which gives a 1 output when the number of 1 inputs is odd, otherwise it gives 0 output. For simplicity, if we take two inputs then it will give true output if one and only one of the inputs is true. It is denoted by ⊕ symbol.

7) A XNOR Gate  is also known as eXclusive NOT OR(NOR) gate. It gives a true output when all the inputs are the same otherwise gives a false output. It is denoted by the combination of bar symbol(‾) and XOR symbol (⊕).
