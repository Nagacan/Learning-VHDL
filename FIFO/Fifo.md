A FIFO (First-In, First-Out) circuit is a type of digital memory that stores data in a specific order, where the first piece of data written into the circuit is also the first to be read out. Also known as queue or buffer memories, FIFOs are commonly used to manage data flow between different devices that may operate at different speeds. They consist of a storage array, read and write pointers, and control logic, with the pointers tracking the locations for reading and writing data
