Project Requirements:

Design HDL code that will blink an LED at a specified frequency of 100 Hz, 50 Hz, 10 Hz, or 1 Hz. For each of the blink frequencies, the LED will be set to **50% duty cycle (it will be on half the time)**. The LED frequency will be chosen via two switches which are inputs to the FPGA. There is an additional switch called LED_EN that needs to be ‘1’ to turn on the LED. The FPGA will be driven by a 25 MHz oscillator.
