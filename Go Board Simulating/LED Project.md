Since we are using all 4 LEDs, we need to **keep the state of each LED individually**

Each LED **blinks at different rates**, so we will need to keep counters to keep track of time for each LED

Use this link for VHDL https://www.edaplayground.com/. 

On this website there will be two files, the file on the right "design.vhd" is the LED blinking code, and the one on the left is the testbench code, "testbench.vhd".
